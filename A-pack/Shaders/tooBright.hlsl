 (1 texture, 3 arithmetic)

Apply when the picture is too bright.
Decreases brightness without clipping (Black point and White point are not changed).

Photoshop Multiply Blend, brightness/contrast curve:
out = (1-Multiply)*x + Multiply*x*x = Multiply*x^2 -Multiply*x +x
	with c0: pixel.rgb in [0, 1.0]
	and Multiply>=0

parameter Multiply [-1, 1.0], 0: no effect.
>> Positive: (Multiply Blend) decreases brightness. Increases contrast in highlights. ex: 0.20
	- Brightness decrease is maximum at the mid-point (-Multiply/4).
	- Contrast = 2*Multiply*x +1-Multiply
	Contrast increases linearly with input level and is maximum at the White point (1+Multiply).
	Contrast: 1 at the mid-point.

negative: (Screen Blend) increases brightness.
