Apply when the picture is too dark.
Increases brightness without clipping (Black point and White point are not changed).

Photoshop Screen Blend, brightness/contrast curve:
out = -Screen*x*x + (1+Screen)*x = -Screen*x^2 +Screen*x + x
    with x, out: pixel.rgb in [0, 1.0]
    and Screen >=0

parameter Screen [-1, 1.0], 0: no effect.
>> Positive: (Screen Blend) increases brightness, increases constrast in shadows, ex: 0.24
    - Brightness increase is maximum at the mid-point (Screen/4).
    - Contrast = 1+Screen -2*Screen*x
    Contrast is maximum: (1+Screen) at the black point and decreases linearly with input level.
    Contrast:1 at the mid-point.

negative: (Multiply Blend) decreases brightness, increases contrast in highlights.
